# TrackHR

This is a system built to be able to check the progress of workers on their current tasks. 
There is a hierarchy of people with different roles in a company, and each can monitor a different set
of employees. Admins will be able to see everyone, managers will be able to see anyone underneath
managerial and admin positions, supervisors will only be able to see workers. Workers will only
be able to see the work that they are doing with respective deadlines.
